## Devlog 4

These devlogs are mostly point form and basically reflect how I think about things. They document both what I learned and ideas that cross my mind. I make lists because my thoughts are usually in complete chaos, and organising them like that is a way to convince myself that it all makes sense.

### Week 5: Devlog 4 (Feb 8, 2018)

I keep thinking thinking about all the possbilities of this project. I have a story I would like to tell. When I got to visit the Strong Museum of Play because I got a research fellowship there, I came in contact with some documents on Danielle Bunten Berry. She was truly an amazing person and I would like to tell her story, or at least part of it. She was one of the mastermind behind M.U.L.E and Seven Cities of Gold. Those games eventually inspired Sid Meier to create Pirates! and then Civilization. The Game Changer exhibit talks about Civ, I can most likely use the panel that mentions that game to talk about her. Her story deserves to be told. I'll know more when I talk with the Canada Science and Technology Museum people, something came up and I was not able to talk to them this week.
