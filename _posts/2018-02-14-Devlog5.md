## Devlog 3

These devlogs are mostly point form and basically reflect how I think about things. They document both what I learned and ideas that cross my mind. I make lists because my thoughts are usually in complete chaos, and organising them like that is a way to convince myself that it all makes sense.

### Week 5: Devlog 3 (Feb 14, 2018)

Had a talk with the people at the Canada Sciecne and Technology Museum and I will be able to do my project with them. The person who was in charge of the Game Changers exhibit is willing to share the public access documents they have from when they were creating the exhibit. 

I decided to work on one potential story for the project, but I ended up with the same issue they had when coming up with the text on their panels. It has to be under 80 words and clear. Telling a story in under 80 words is very hard. This is making me reconsider the sotries I wanted to tell. Nevertheless, this still seems like a promising idea.
