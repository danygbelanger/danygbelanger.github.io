## Devlog 9

These devlogs are mostly point form and basically reflect how I think about things. They document both what I learned and ideas that cross my mind. I make lists because my thoughts are usually in complete chaos, and organising them like that is a way to convince myself that it all makes sense.

### Week 8: Devlog 9 (Mar 29, 2018)

Let's talk paradata.

So, I though I would put in my paradata on this website to show where I'm at and what I am using. When I was talking to the people at the Canada Science and Technology Museum, they gave me so much information. I guess this would be part of my paradata, but most of it I did not end up using. I would put it online, because most of it is supposed to be public access, but there's so much that I feel it would be more confusing to put it all here. There is a tactic by some corporate lawyer who will do document dumps in order to lengthen and complicate the work of people will less means who are suing these big-time corporations. While I would not be attempting to obfuscate what I am doing, I feel like giving too much ends up also being a problem. In any case, under this paragraph I am putting links to websites I used to create my story, embedding pictures I am using, and simply describing other material that I canâ€™t post but can about.
