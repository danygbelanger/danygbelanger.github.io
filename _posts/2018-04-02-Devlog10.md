## Devlog 10

These devlogs are mostly point form and basically reflect how I think about things. They document both what I learned and ideas that cross my mind. I make lists because my thoughts are usually in complete chaos, and organising them like that is a way to convince myself that it all makes sense.

### Week 8: Devlog 9 (Apr 02, 2018)

Well my project is coming to a close. It was not what I had imagined it would be. I have added some videos since the last devlog, but the time and size limit is slightly disappointing.  

I also started importing everything in HP Reveal, but I always get a problem with the orientations of picture. I requires me to either retake the picture of the triggers or print screen them and save them again. This has been a problem for the software, even before it become HP Reveal, and it is very annoying. Supposedly, you can change the orientation of the file on your computer to fix this, but it is not working on my laptop… I took screenshots  and it still seems to work even if I have don’t edit out the black bars on each side. I guess it works, but I’m not sure if I think this is good or not.

It is slightly weird though, I have tried them on multiple occasions and they don’t seem to work consistently. Sometimes they do, others they don’t. Yet, I have not modified anything. Perhaps it’s the lighting?
