## Devlog 3

These devlogs are mostly point form and basically reflect how I think about things. They document both what I learned and ideas that cross my mind. I make lists because my thoughts are usually in complete chaos, and organising them like that is a way to convince myself that it all makes sense.

### Week 4: Devlog 3 (Feb 1, 2018)

1. Swearing is an integral part of digital work. Cursing at your machine... Can't stop myself from thinking of a really bad pun. You could say that digital work will make you rage against the machine...
2. My possbile project
  * The silences of game changers
    + Potentially using some of the removed stuff or what did not make the cut
    + How to do Guerilla Public History without the fear of losing job opportunities
 3. Mapinators
