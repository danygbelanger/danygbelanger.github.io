## Devlog 3

These devlogs are mostly point form and basically reflect how I think about things. They document both what I learned and ideas that cross my mind. I make lists because my thoughts are usually in complete chaos, and organising them like that is a way to convince myself that it all makes sense.

### Week 4: Devlog 3 (Feb 1, 2018)

1. Swearing is an integral part of digital work. Cursing at your machine... Can't stop myself from thinking of a really bad pun. You could say that digital work will make you rage against the machine...
2. My possbile project
  * The silences of game changers
    + Potentially using some of the removed stuff or what did not make the cut
    + How to do Guerilla Public History without the fear of losing job opportunities
3. Mapinators, new word we came up with. We can only hope it will chatch on.

#### Thoughts:

I had resigned myself even before I started. I thought that I could not do something relating to my research, but I had not talked to enough people, or the right person. I feel this is probably why so many novel projects and ideas don't come to fruition. 

There are multiple reasons why this happens, but I will use my situation as exmaple. As I am getting closer to completing my Master's, I grow more tired and exhausted. Anxiety is making me sleep less than I should, which slows me down. This makes me more nervous about how much work I manage to accomplish, making me sleep even less. A vicious circle. This situation causes me to choose the safe route, rather than take risks. Also, I want to push, challenge, upset, but I fear for my career prospects if I rock the boat a little too hard. 
 
Our last class discussion has given me the push I needed to see the worth in taking risks, which could possibly improve my chances at finding a job after this. Contacted someone at Science and Tech to discuss my project, meeting them on Tuesday (Feb 6). 

This might work out.
